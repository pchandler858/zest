## Description

We were motivated to create a job tracking app because we wanted to create a tool that would help us organize our job search. Zest allows us to save jobs, contacts, and events to a calendar. This prevents us from applying to the same job twice and allows us to keep track of our progress.

## Installation

NA

## Usage and Testing

To use Zest, create an account and login. Once logged in, you can add jobs, contacts, and events to your profile. You can also update your profile picture.

Future updates will include a more robust editing and job tracking system.
